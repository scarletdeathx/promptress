# Promptress

Welcome to **Promptress**. This is where I store Python files with AI-generated code snippets, generated by ChatGPT. Learning programming languages? Not everyone's cup of tea, including me. That's why this exists. The project is less about utility and more an exploration into what an AI thinks we want to code next. Think of it as an art installation, but for code.

The aim is straightforward: offer a resource based on the language model's predictions. Whether those predictions are accurate or wildly off, that's not the point. It's about the AI's algorithmic interpretation of software development.

Browse if you want. You might find something of interest, or just get an insight into AI logic. Take it or leave it.
